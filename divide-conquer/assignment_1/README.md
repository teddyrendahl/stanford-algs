# Programming Assignment 1
In this programming assignment you will implement one or more of the integer
multiplication algorithms described in lecture.

To get the most out of this assignment, your program should restrict itself to
multiplying only pairs of single-digit numbers. You can implement the
grade-school algorithm if you want, but to get the most out of the assignment
you'll want to implement recursive integer multiplication and/or Karatsuba's
algorithm.

So: what's the product of the following two 64-digit numbers?

`3141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592`
